 * belongs to the flow and runs regardless of what its consumers do.
 *
 * Consumers are followed transitively. A model feeding a parser feeding a
 * disabled agent is as inert as one feeding the disabled agent directly, and
 * stopping at the first hop would refuse to publish over it.
 *
 * `canOutputMain` reads the type's declared outputs rather than the
 * connections, since an unwired `main` output is still a main-path node. It must
 * answer `true` when unsure, so a half-built graph does not silently opt out of
