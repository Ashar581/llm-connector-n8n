/**
 * Names of every node that can run when execution starts at `startNodeName`,
 * including the start node itself.
 *
 * This is the forward `main` closure of the start node, plus the sub-nodes
 * (tool / language model / memory, etc.) attached to any node in that closure.
 * Sub-nodes are wired in the opposite direction — the sub-node is the source of
 * an `ai_*` connection whose destination is its parent — so a plain forward walk
 * misses them; we pick them up by walking `ALL_NON_MAIN` connections backwards
 * from each reachable node. Nodes not reachable from the start node (a disjoint
 * branch, a second trigger's chain) are excluded, since they never execute on
 * this run.
 *
 * @param connectionsBySourceNode  connections indexed by source (Workflow.connectionsBySourceNode)
 * @param connectionsByDestinationNode  connections indexed by destination (Workflow.connectionsByDestinationNode)
 * @param startNodeName  the node execution starts from (the active trigger)
